     * \brief Qt-based client library for NGF daemon (Non-Graphic Feedback)
     *
     * Ngf::Client is Qt-based client library for NGF daemon (Non-Graphic Feedback). Client can
     * be used to initiate non-graphical events, for example audio and vibra.
     *
     * NGF daemon defines set of actions for each event, for example "ringtone" event might be associated
     * with audio playback and vibra sequence. NGF daemon communicates with profiled to stay in sync
     * with the system sounds and volume levels settings. NGF daemon then uses for example PulseAudio
     * Stream Restore module to store volume levels and GStreamer to play audio streams.
     *
     * NGF::Client is introduced to allow simple use of NGF daemon without the need to know communication
     * details between daemon and client.
